Following this, the user was presented with a checklist of additional features, including options to add customer testimonials, social media sharing buttons, a mailing list signup form, an FAQ section, and a product gallery. The AI asked about the placement and style of the updated copyright text. The user continued making feature requests, such as adding a button that triggers an alert when clicked, prompting the AI to ask for details on the alert message and button style, which the user provided.\n\nThe user also requested enhancements for the \"Shop Now\" button to display an alert, and after confirming this action, further adjustments were discussed, including changing text colors and implementing a responsive design for mobile devices. The AI acknowledged each request, assuring that all changes would be made accordingly.\n\nLater, the user reiterated the need for the \"Shop Now\" button to alert again, which was acknowledged by the AI. Furthermore, the user wanted the shop button to show the message \"shopping now!\" in an alert. Additional features were again proposed by the AI, with specifics on a textbox about water bottles. The user finalized their request by asking to add a textbox with some informative copy about water bottles, which the AI confirmed it would implement. Overall, the interactions focused on updating website features to enhance user experience and site functionality.",
