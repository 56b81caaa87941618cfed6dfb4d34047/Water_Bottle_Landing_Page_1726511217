Additionally, the user was presented with a checklist of additional features to enhance their project, which included options such as updating UI elements, including a customer review section, integrating social media buttons, and adding a subscription form, among others. The user was also prompted with specific questions regarding the type of alert they preferred for the 'shopping now!' message and whether they had specific styling colors in mind for the button. They have indicated a preference for these features through their responses.\n\nFurthermore, the user asked the AI to add a textbox featuring information about water bottles, which the AI acknowledged and proceeded to implement. The user was later asked about the content to include in the textbox, with options related to product features and sustainability. They were also questioned about the textbox's positioning on the landing page, providing further detail for the AI to execute the request efficiently. Throughout this exchange, the user explored various enhancement options while the AI assisted by confirming actions and providing tailored questions.",
